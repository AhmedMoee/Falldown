# Falldown
Falldown is a simple falling block dodging game built using the uvage game engine for Python. The player controls a block that falls from the top of the screen and must avoid gaps in the floor to stay alive.

The game generates walls on the left and right sides of the screen and randomly placed floor segments with a gap in between. The player uses the arrow keys to move the block left and right to avoid falling through the gap. As the game progresses, the floors move faster and the gap gets wider, increasing the challenge.
The player's score increases gradually over time as long as the block hasn't fallen through. If the block falls off the bottom of the screen, the game ends, and the player can press space to restart.
